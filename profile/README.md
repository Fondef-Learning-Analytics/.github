# FONDEF Learning Analytics Project - EOL, Universidad de Chile

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the FONDEF Learning Analytics project. This project is an initiative of EOL (Oficina de Educación Online) at Universidad de Chile and is funded by the Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDEF).

## About Us

We are a group of educators, researchers, engineers and data scientists committed to improving the state of education. We leverage modern technologies and methodologies such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Big Data to analyze student behavior, provide insights, and enable proactive measures in education.

Learning Analytics is a rapidly growing field that uses data from learners and their contexts to understand and optimize learning experiences and the environments in which they occur. The data generated by online learning environments provides rich information about students' behaviors, interactions, and preferences. We use these data, combined with advanced analytics techniques, to derive insights that can enhance teaching and learning processes.

## Our Projects

Our repositories reflect a diverse array of projects, all aiming to leverage data to improve educational outcomes. These range from learning prediction models to interactive dashboards for educators, data processing pipelines, and more.
